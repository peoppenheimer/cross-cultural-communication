This project is a paper that I'll deliver initially as linguistics research
seminar in to the University of Adelaide Linguistics Research Seminar, convened
by Ghil'ad Zuckermann in the Department of Linguistics at the University of
Adelaide on 4 October 2016.  It's based on Leibniz's fragment "A Study in the
Calculus of Real Addition" (G.W. Leibniz (after 1690), “A Study In the Calculus
of Real Addition”, *Leibniz: Logical Papers* (edited by G.H.R. Parkinson),
Oxford, 1966, 131–144.).  It draws on lots of subsequent scholarship
concerning that fragment.  The biggest challenge is to make it suitable for a
research seminar in the Department of *Linguistics*.
