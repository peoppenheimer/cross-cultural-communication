This project is a paper that I'll deliver initially as an undergraduate lecture in Ghil'ad
 Zuckermann's linguistics course on cross-cultural communication at the University of 
 Adelaide in September of 2016.  It's based on Leibniz's fragment "A Study in the 
 Calculus of Real Addition" (G.W. Leibniz (after 1690), “A Study In the Calculus of Real 
 Addition”, *Leibniz: Logical Papers* (edited by
G.H.R. Parkinson), Oxford, 1966, 131–144.).  It draws on lots of subsequent scholarship 
concerning that fragment.  The biggest challenge is to make it suitable for undergraduate 
students.
