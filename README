This project is a paper that I'll deliver initially to the Linguistics
Research Seminar at the University of Adelaide. It's based on
Leibniz's fragment "A Study in the Calculus of Real Addition"
(G.W. Leibniz (after 1690), “A Study In the Calculus of Real
Addition”, *Leibniz: Logical Papers* (edited by G.H.R. Parkinson),
Oxford, 1966, 131–144.). It draws on lots of subsequent scholarship
concerning that fragment. The biggest challenge is to make it suitable
for a research seminar in the Department of *Linguistics*.
